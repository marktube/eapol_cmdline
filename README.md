# eapol_cmdline

EAPOL command line tools on Mac OS X.

Sources are taken from Apple’s EAPOL implementation — [http://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/eap8021x/](http://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/eap8021x/)

Add some headers by myself.

Use Apple's private frameworks to build. See more details in the makefile.

Enjoy~
